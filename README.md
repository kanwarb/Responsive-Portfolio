# Responsive-Portfolio

 ### Update the previous homework to a Responsive Layout using Media Queries
  
       Enhance the basic portfolio using the Media Queries with screen size with different pixel count.

       For each of the screen sizes a Media Query with corresponding hight, width , margins, color , font and footer were setup so the layout will fit in the display's aspect ratio.
